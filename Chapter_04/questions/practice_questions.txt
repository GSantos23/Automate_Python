1. What is [] ?
It represents an empty list


2. How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored
in a variable named spam ? (Assume spam contains [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] .)
spam[2] = 'hello'


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the following three questions , let's say spam contains the list:
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']


3. What does spam[int(int('3'* 2) // 11)] evaluate to?
'd', given that the operation is 33 // 11 equal to 3.


4. What does spam[-1] evaluate to?
'd', the last element of the list


5. What does spam[:2] evaluate to?
['a', 'b']. From begining of list to n-1, so from 0 to 1.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the following  three questions, let's say bacon contains the list:

bacon =[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True]

6. What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?
1


7. What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?
Add 99 to the bacon list
bacon = [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]


8. What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?
Remove the first instance of 'cat' in the list
bacon = [3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99]


9. What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication?
+, *

10. What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?
append() -- insert element at the  end of the list
insert() -- insert element at specific position of the list


11. What are two ways to remove values from a list?
del()    --  Deletes specific value via index in the list
remove() -- Deletes specific value via value in the list


12. Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values.
They can use len(), and slices


13. What is the difference between lists and tuples?
list uses [] and they are mutable (it can be changed)
tuple uses () and they are inmmutable (it cannot be changed)


14. How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it?
myTuple = (42,)


15. How can you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list
form of a tuple value?

list_to_tuple = tuple(some_list)
tuple_to_list = list(some_tuple)


16. Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly.
What do they contain instead?
A list of references


17. What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy() ?
copy.copy() -- Allows a copy of a dictionary or list a real duplicate
copy.deepcopy() -- Same as the previous one but recursive, in case of a list
of list it also copy the inner list
