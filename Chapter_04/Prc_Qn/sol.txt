1. What is [] ?
    
    Square brakets, used to represent a list


2. How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored in
    a variable named spam ? (Assume spam contains [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] .)

    spam[2] = 'hello'   # [2, 4, 'hello', 8, 10]


For the following three questions, let’s say spam contains the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] .

3. What does spam[int('3' * 2) / 11] evaluate to?
    
    Show us an error TypeError, is looking for an integer for the indices


4. What does spam[-1] evaluate to?    'd'


5. What does spam[:2] evaluate to?    ['a', 'b']


For the following three questions, let’s say bacon contains the list [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True] .

6. What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?  1


7. What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?

    [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]


8. What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?

    [3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99]


9. What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication?

    list concatenation: list1 + list2 + ...
    list replication: list1 * someValue


10. What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?

    list.append() --  insert item to last position of list
    list.insert() --  insert item to specified position of list


11. What are two ways to remove values from a list?

    del statement and list.remove()


12. Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values.

    * A string is a immutable data type, but could be like a list using list() cast function

    * Strings supports slicing to access to specific character of the string


13. What is the difference between lists and tuples?

    * list are mutable (they can be modified)
    * listName = []
    * tuples are immutable (they cannot be modified)
    * tupleName = ()


14. How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it?

    list(someVar = [42])
    someVar = [42]


15. How can you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list
form of a tuple value?

    * tuple(listName = [])
    * list(tupleName = ())


16. Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly.
What do they contain instead?

    They contain a list reference (like a pointer to a memory)


17. What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy() ?

    * copy.copy() -- Creates a copy of a list to avoid issues with list references
    * copy.deepcopy() -- Creates a copy of a list of list, similar to the first one
