    The first one gives us the valueKey in spam={}, while spam.keys() returns a 
    string with the keyName 


6. If a dictionary is stored in spam , what is the difference between the
    expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.values() ?

    The same, however spam.values() give us a different format


7. What is a shortcut for the following code?

    ------------------------------------------

    ------------------------------------------

    spam.setdefault('color', 'black')


8. What module and function can be used to “pretty print” dictionary values?

    import pprint

    pprint.pprint(someDictionaryValue)
    print(pprint.pformat(someDictionaryValue))
