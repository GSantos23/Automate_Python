1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

    True and False. True and False

2. What are the three Boolean operators?

    or, and, not. 

3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every
   possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what 
   they evaluate to).

    or
    op1     op2     Result
    ----------------------
    False   False   False
    False   True    True
    True    False   True
    True    True    True

    and
    op1     op2     Result
    ----------------------
    False   False   False
    False   True    False
    True    False   False
    True    True    True

    not
    op1     Result
    ----------------------
    False   True
    True    False

4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?

    (5 > 4) and (3 == 5)                        : False
    not (5 > 4)                                 : False
    (5 > 4) or (3 == 5)                         : True
    not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))                   : False
    (True and True) and (True == False)         : False
    (not False) or (not True)                   : True

5. What are the six comparison operators?

    >, <, ==, !=, >=, <=

6. What is the difference between equal to operator and assignment operator?
    
    Equal to operator (==), is used to compare the value between to variables.
    Assignment operator (=), is used to assign/associate a value to a variable.

7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one
    
    Is the comparision between values that generates a boolean expression, that
    later is going to be used in the program.

8. Identify the three blocks in this code:

spam = 0
----------------------------
if spam == 10:
*********************************
    print('eggs')
    /////////////////////////
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')
    else:
        print('ham')
    //////////////////////
    print('spam')
---------------------------
print('spam')

9. Check ej_9.py

10. What keys can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?
    
    CTRL + C

11. What is the difference between break and continue ?

    break, exits loop scope immediately.

    continue, returns to begining of loop scope to reevaluate the condition.

12. What is the difference between range(10) , range(0, 10) , and range(0, 10, 1)
    in a for loop?

    range(10),    -- Count upto 10 (0 to 9)
    range(0,10)   -- count from 0 to 9 in jumps of 1.
    range(0,10,1) -- count from 0 to 9 in jumps of 1.

13. Check ej_13.py

14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam , how would 
    you call it after importing spam ?

    from spam import bacon

Extra credit:

 round(number[, ndigits]) 

 Return number rounded to ndigits precision after the decimal point. 
 If ndigits is omitted or is None, it returns the nearest integer to its input.


abs(x)

Return the absolute value of a number. The argument may be an integer or a 
floating point number. If the argument is a complex number, its magnitude is returned.
